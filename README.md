# category_projections

This repository is for the postprocess applied to predictions of q30.  It is being treated as a separate project for now, as it is uncertain at this point how we integrate into the current prediction framework.  Additionally, there are a few customer requests for category size which fall outside the scope of JD (for which our q30 predictions currently only are modeled for).  This project allows for category size estimates without the need for the very advanced, and likely heavily JD-biased, q30 prediction algorithm currently employed by Early Data.
